# Utilitiy for training neural network models for emulating PV-DER dynamics

Solar photovoltaic distributed energy resources (PV-DER) are power electronic inverter based generation (IBG) connected to the electric power distribution system (eg. roof top solar PV systems). This utility can be used to simulate the behaviour a single DER connected to a stiff voltage source as shown in the following schematic:
