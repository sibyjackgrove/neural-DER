# Utilitiy for training neural network models that emulate PV-DER dynamics

This module is based on the [Solar PV-DER simulation utility](https://github.com/sibyjackgrove/SolarPV-DER-simulation-utility) module. It provides methods to generate training data, as well as define, train, and evaluate neural networks that emulate the dynamics of a Solar photovoltaic distributed energy resource (PV-DER) connected to a stiff voltage source.
